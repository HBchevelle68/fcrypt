# fcrypt

File encryption/decryption tool I am building for fun and because it would be useful to have. Still under development.

## Environment and Dependancies
* Ubuntu 16.04.02
* C++11
* crypto++ 5.6.5
* g++ with -std=c++11 -lcryptopp flags
* All encryption files are wrapper libraries I wrote for a another project (https://github.com/HBchevelle68/SafeSpace)
